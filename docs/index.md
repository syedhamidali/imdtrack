# imdtrack

**IMD RSMC New Delhi cyclone best-track data as tidy pandas DataFrames and
CF-style xarray Datasets — kept up to date automatically.**

The parsed dataset lives in the project's GitHub repo (rebuilt from the IMD
workbook by a monthly, validated pipeline). `imd.load()` downloads that
pre-parsed data — no Excel scraping on your machine.

```python
import imdtrack as imd

bt = imd.load()                       # pre-parsed dataset from GitHub (cached)
bt.observations                       # one tidy row per 3-hourly fix
bt.storms                             # one summary row per storm
bt.to_xarray()                        # (storm, step) xarray.Dataset
imd.plot_track(bt.storm("tauktae"))   # cartopy map  (needs the [plot] extra)
```
