The [India Meteorological Department (RSMC New Delhi)](https://rsmcnewdelhi.imd.gov.in/)
**cyclone best-track record** — every depression and cyclonic storm in the North
Indian Ocean (Bay of Bengal & Arabian Sea) since 1982 — as a tidy **pandas
DataFrame** or a CF-style **xarray Dataset**, kept up to date automatically.

IMD publishes the record as a single, hand-maintained Excel workbook. `imdtrack`
turns it into clean, analysis-ready tables. The parsed dataset is committed to
this repo (under [`data/`](data/)) and refreshed by a monthly GitHub Action, so
`imd.load()` just downloads the pre-parsed data — no Excel parsing on your side.

## Install

```bash
pip install imdtrack            # core: pandas + pyarrow (reads the published parquet)
pip install imdtrack[xarray]    # + xarray/numpy for .to_xarray()
pip install imdtrack[plot]      # + cartopy/matplotlib for map plotting
pip install imdtrack[all]       # xarray + numpy + openpyxl
```

Or with [conda](https://conda-forge.org/) / [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge imdtrack   # core package
uv add imdtrack                          # into a project  (or: uv pip install imdtrack)
```

| Extra | Adds | For |
|---|---|---|
| *(none)* | pandas, pyarrow | loading the data as DataFrames |
| `xarray` | xarray, numpy | `bt.to_xarray()` |
| `plot` | cartopy, matplotlib | `imd.plot_track()` map plots |
| `pipeline` | openpyxl | parsing the IMD workbook yourself (`source="imd"`) |

> `cartopy` has no Python 3.14 wheel yet, so the `[plot]` extra needs Python ≤ 3.13
> (or a conda/system GEOS+PROJ to build it). `conda install -c conda-forge imdtrack`
> pulls in a prebuilt cartopy, sidestepping this.

## Usage

```python
import imdtrack as imd

bt = imd.load()                 # pre-parsed dataset from GitHub (cached)
df = bt.observations            # tidy DataFrame: one row per 3-hourly fix
ds = bt.to_xarray()             # (storm, step) xarray.Dataset

bt = imd.load(update=True)      # re-download only if the repo published new data

bt.storm("2020-001")            # one storm's track (AMPHAN)
bt.storms                       # one row per storm (peak grade, max wind, ...)
bt.remarks                      # landfall / weakening notes, linked by storm_id
```

### The tidy `observations` frame

| column | meaning |
|---|---|
| `storm_id` | stable id, `"<year>-<serial>"` e.g. `2020-001` |
| `year`, `serial` | year and serial number of the system within that year |
| `basin` | `BOB` (Bay of Bengal), `ARB` (Arabian Sea), or `LAND` |
| `name` | cyclone name (blank for unnamed / older systems) |
| `time` | observation time (UTC, `datetime64`) |
| `lat`, `lon` | position (°N, °E) |
| `ci_no` | Dvorak CI / T-number |
| `pressure` | estimated central pressure (hPa) |
| `wind` | maximum sustained surface wind (knots) |
| `pressure_drop` | pressure drop / ΔP (hPa) |
| `grade` | ordered category: `D < DD < CS < SCS < VSCS < ESCS < SuCS` |
| `oci`, `oci_diameter` | outermost closed isobar pressure (hPa) & diameter (°) |
| `step` | 0-based fix index within the storm |

### The xarray Dataset

Laid out like [IBTrACS](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/international-best-track-archive):
a ragged track becomes a 2-D `(storm, step)` grid. Per-fix variables span both
dims; storm-level metadata (`name`, `basin`, `year`, …) are `storm` coordinates.

```python
ds = bt.to_xarray()
ds.sel(storm="2020-001")["wind"].max()      # AMPHAN peak intensity
ds.where(ds.basin == "ARB", drop=True)      # Arabian Sea storms only
```

See the [documentation](https://imdtrack.readthedocs.io/) for a full walkthrough
and a North Indian Ocean climatology example.

## Staying up to date

A [monthly GitHub Action](.github/workflows/update-dataset.yml) re-fetches the
IMD workbook and, only if it parses and passes validation, updates `data/` — a
broken upload can never overwrite the good published data. You normally don't
have to do anything; `imd.load(update=True)` pulls the latest.

## Data quality

The library mirrors the IMD workbook faithfully, including its occasional
data-entry errors. Two conservative, **non-destructive** checks flag them — the
source values are never altered:

- **`pos_suspect`** — a fix whose coordinates imply an impossible jump (isolated
  position spike), e.g. a corrupted latitude.
- **`date_suspect`** — a day/month-transposed date, e.g. Nargis (2008) where
  May 1–3 were stored as "01/05, 02/05, 03/05" (Jan/Feb/Mar 5).

```python
bt = imd.load()
bt.observations.query("pos_suspect or date_suspect")   # inspect flagged fixes
bt.clean()                        # drop position spikes (or clean(how="mask"))
bt.clean(fix_dates=True)          # also swap day/month back and re-order the track
```

These catch the common, well-defined cases; a few storms have messier date
corruption that is left as-is (visible as an implausibly long `start_time`–`end_time` span).

## Notes & caveats

- Data © India Meteorological Department. This library only reformats it; verify
  against IMD for operational use. The most recent season is *tentative* until
  IMD's post-season review.
- Older years often lack storm names and some fields (e.g. central pressure);
  those appear as `NaN`.
